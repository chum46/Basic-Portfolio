        <!--Text About me -->
        <p>I am currently studying full stack web development at Northwestern’s Coding Bootcamp and have an undergraduate degree from Purdue University (BS, Mechanical Engineering Technology, 2007). For the last 10 years my professional background has been in the mechanical engineering and industrial automation fields.  Most recently I worked as an Engineering Specialist for Fastenal Company’s national accounts team where I provided design consultation, application assistance, failure analysis and training for qualifying customers.</p>
        <p>Outside of the manufacturing industry I am a visual artist and stay connected to the Chicago art community by helping produce quarterly exhibitions for local artists.  In taking this step toward development and coding, I hope to move into a career path that will merge my engineering and artistic backgrounds into a more creative, fast-paced and progressive work environment.</p>
